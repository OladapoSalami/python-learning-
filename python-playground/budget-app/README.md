# 💰 Budget App Project
This project is part of my **Scientific Computing with Python** certification. 

### What it does:
* Creates a `Category` class to track deposits and withdrawals.
* Calculates spending percentages across different categories.
* Generates a visual bar chart of spending.

### How to run it:
Run the `main.py` file to see a demonstration of the budget tracking and the spend chart.
