# 📐 Polygon Area Calculator
This project uses Object-Oriented Programming to calculate the area, perimeter, and diagonal of rectangles and squares.

### 🧠 Key Concept: Inheritance
The `Square` class is a **subclass** of the `Rectangle` class. Instead of rewriting the math for area and perimeter, the Square inherits those methods from the Rectangle, demonstrating code reusability.

### 🛠 Skills Demonstrated:
* **Class Inheritance:** Using `super().__init__()` to pass data to parent classes.
* **Method Overriding:** Customizing how `set_width` and `set_height` work for a Square to keep sides equal.
* **String Representation:** Using the `__str__` method to provide readable object descriptions.
* **Logic:** Calculating how many times one shape can fit inside another.
